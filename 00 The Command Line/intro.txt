A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing
them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal
will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common
one is called BASH which stands for Bourne Again SHell.
