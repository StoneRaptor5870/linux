The Manual Pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system.
Including what they do, how they run and arguments they accept.

Command to invoke manual pages:
man <command to look up>
man -k <search term>

/<term>
If you want to search within a manual page this is also possible. To do this, whilst you are in the particular manual page
you would like to search press forward slash '/' followed by the term you would like to search for and hit 'enter' If the
term appears multiple times you may cycle through them by pressing the 'n' button for next.
