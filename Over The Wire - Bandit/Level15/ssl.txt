openssl s_client Command
openssl s_client is a tool that can be used to establish SSL/TLS connections to a server and view/debug the SSL/TLS handshake and communication. It's often used for testing and debugging SSL/TLS connections.

-ign_eof Option
The -ign_eof option tells openssl s_client to ignore the EOF (End Of File) signal. By default, when s_client encounters an EOF from the server, it will close the connection. The -ign_eof option prevents this behavior, allowing you to keep the connection open and continue interacting with the server.

HEARTBEATING and Read R BLOCK
These messages are related to the TLS Heartbeat extension, which was the source of the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability. The messages indicate that the server is sending heartbeat requests or responses. They can be safely ignored in most testing scenarios but are an indication of active heartbeat functionality.

CONNECTED COMMANDS Section
The CONNECTED COMMANDS section in the openssl s_client manpage describes commands you can use while connected to a server using s_client. These commands allow you to interact with the connection in various ways.

Common Connected Commands:
R: Renegotiate the SSL/TLS session.
Q: Quit the connection.
B: Send a heartbeat request.
Practical Usage Example
Here’s how you can use the openssl s_client command with the -ign_eof option and interact with the server using connected commands:

Connect to a Server:

sh
Copy code
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -ign_eof
This command connects to example.com on port 443 and ignores the EOF signal, keeping the connection open.

Interacting with the Connection:
While connected, you can use the following commands:

R: Renegotiate the session.
Type R and press Enter.
Q: Quit the connection.
Type Q and press Enter.
B: Send a heartbeat request.
Type B and press Enter.
Example Session
Here’s what an interactive session might look like:

sh
Copy code
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -ign_eof
Upon connecting, you might see output similar to this:

While connected, you can type the commands R, Q, or B followed by pressing Enter to renegotiate, quit, or send a heartbeat, respectively.

This setup and the provided commands will help you debug and interact with SSL/TLS connections more effectively.
