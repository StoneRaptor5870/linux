A command line editor
Vi is a command line text editor.
There are two modes in Vi. Insert (or Input) mode and Edit mode. In input mode you may input or enter content into the file.
In edit mode you can move around the file, perform actions such as deleting, copying, search and replace, saving etc.

vi <file>
Switch to insert mode by pressing i.
Type in a few lines of text and press Esc which will take you back to edit mode.

Saving and Exit

ZZ (Note: capitals) - Save and exit
:q! - discard all changes, since the last save, and exit
:w - save file but don't exit
:wq - again, save and exit

Most commands within vi are executed as soon as you press a sequence of keys. Any command beginning
with a colon ( : ) requires you to hit <enter> to complete the command.
