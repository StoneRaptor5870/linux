Piping

A mechanism for sending data from one program to another. It's called piping and the operator we use is ( | ).

barry.txt bob example.png firstfile foo1 myoutput video.mpeg
user@bash: ls | head -3
barry.txt
bob

Combine pipes and redirection

user@bash: ls | head -3 | tail -1 > myoutput
user@bash: cat myoutput
