Everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is 
a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc.

Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.
So for instance I could have a file myself.png which is a picture of me. I could rename the file to myself.txt or just myself
and Linux would still happily treat the file as an image file.

- file [path]
user@bash:~/repos/linux/02 Files$ file files.txt
files.txt: ASCII text

Relative path
user@bash:~/repos/linux$ file 02\ Files/files.txt
02 Files/files.txt: ASCII text

Tt would be more accurate to say that a path is a means to get to a particular location in the system and that location is a file.
